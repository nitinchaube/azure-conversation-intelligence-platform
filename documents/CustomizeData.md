## Customize the solution with your own data 

If you would like to update the solution to leverage your own data please follow the steps below. 
> Note: you will need to complete the deployment steps [here](./DeploymentGuide.md) before proceeding. 

## Prerequisites: 
1. Your data will need to be in JSON or wav format with the file name formated prefixed with "convo" then a GUID followed by a timestamp. For more examples of the data format, please review the sample transcripts and audio data included [here](/infra/data/telecom)
    * Example: 
        * Transcripts: `convo_32e38683-bbf7-407e-a541-09b37b77921d_2024-12-07 04%3A00%3A00.json`
        * Audio: `convo_2c703f97-6657-4a15-b8b2-db6b96630b2d_2024-12-06 06_00_00.wav`

1. Navigate to the storage account in the resource group you are using for this solution. 
2. Open the `data` container

> **Note for WAF-aligned deployments:** If your deployment uses private networking, you'll need to log into a VM within the virtual network to upload files. See [VM login instructions](#how-to-login-to-vm-using-azure-bastion) below.

3. If you have audio files, upload them to `custom_audiodata` folder. If you have call transcript files, upload them to `custom_transcripts` folder.
4. Navigate to the terminal and run the `process_custom_data.sh` script to process the new data into the solution with the following commands:
    
    ```bash
    bash ./infra/scripts/process_custom_data.sh
    ```
    
    If you don't have `azd env` then you need to pass parameters along with the command. Parameters are grouped by service for clarity. The command will look like the following:

    ```bash
    bash ./infra/scripts/process_custom_data.sh \
      <Resource-Group-Name> <Azure-Subscription-ID> \
      <Storage-Account-Name> <Storage-Container-Name> \
      <SQL-Server-Name> <SQL-Database-Name> <Backend-User-MID-Client-ID> <Backend-User-MID-Display-Name> \
      <AI-Search-Name> <Search-Endpoint> \
      <AI-Foundry-Resource-ID> <CU-Foundry-Resource-ID> \
      <OpenAI-Endpoint> <Embedding-Model> <Deployment-Model> \
      <CU-Endpoint> <CU-API-Version> <AI-Agent-Endpoint> <Solution-Name>
    ```

## How to Login to VM Using Azure Bastion

For WAF-aligned deployments with private networking:

1. Navigate to your VM in the Azure portal
2. Click **Connect** → **Bastion**
3. Enter your VM credentials (username and password) and click **Connect**
4. Wait for the Bastion connection to establish - this may take a few moments
5. Once connected, you'll have access to the VM desktop/terminal interface
